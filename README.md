# Ecosystem Simulator: Survival of the Fittest

Welcome to "Ecosystem Simulator: Survival of the Fittest"! This project is a 3D ecosystem simulation game developed in Unity, where players have the opportunity to explore the intricacies of an ever-changing environment.

## Description
In "Ecosystem Simulator: Survival of the Fittest," players are tasked with overseeing a procedurally generated ecosystem. With the power to control population sizes and behaviors of various animal species, players must navigate the delicate balance between life and death, evolution and extinction.
